Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes 3,900 customer purchase transactions to uncover patterns in spending behavior, customer segmentation, product performance, and subscription effectiveness. The objective is to translate raw transactional data into actionable business insights using a complete analytics workflow.

Objectives

Understand how customer demographics and behavior impact revenue

Evaluate the effectiveness of subscriptions and discount strategies

Identify high-value customer segments and product dependencies

Demonstrate an end-to-end analytics pipeline from data cleaning to visualization

Dataset Summary

Records: 3,900 transactions

Features: 18 columns including demographics, purchase details, discounts, subscriptions, reviews, and shipping preferences

Products: 25 items across multiple categories

Geographic Coverage: 50 locations

Key Analysis Performed

Revenue comparison by gender and age group

Subscription vs non-subscription spending behavior

Identification of discount-dependent products

Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups

Product performance based on purchase volume and review ratings

Shipping method impact on purchase value

Key Insights

Subscription status does not significantly increase average order value, indicating limited incremental impact

A small loyal customer segment contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue

Several high-volume products rely heavily on discounts, posing potential margin risks

Customers opting for express shipping demonstrate higher purchase values

Business Recommendations

Improve subscription value propositions to convert repeat buyers

Prioritize loyalty programs over blanket discounting

Rebalance discount strategies to protect margins

Promote high-rated products alongside best-sellers

Target high-revenue customer segments with tailored marketing strategies
